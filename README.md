# Personal Website

This is the basic template I made for my personal website http://dorothyhoward.com

It is purposefully "web 2.0" and I have used nothing fancy and did not make it mobile friendly. Designers may be offended by the code. =) However, I've had a few requests to post it, so here you go. Feel free to use permissively, and no need to cite me if you employ it.

My favorite thing I made for this website is the animation on this blog post: http://dorothyhoward.com/july16.html

Thanks!
